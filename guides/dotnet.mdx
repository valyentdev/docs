## Introduction

[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) .NET is the free, open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern apps and powerful cloud services. In this article, we are going to deploy a freshly created .NET app to Valyent.

## Prerequisites

- a UNIX-like system (see [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are using Windows), in order to use the [Valyent CLI](https://docs.valyent.cloud/cli)
- a Valyent account, with a registered payment method (you can sign up [here](https://console.valyent.cloud/auth/sign-up))
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) installed on your machine

## Installing the CLI

```bash
curl -L https://cli.valyent.cloud/install.sh | sh
```

You can inspect the installation script [here](https://cli.valyent.cloud/install.sh) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/valyentdev/cli).

## Authenticating

```bash
valyent auth login
```

## Initializing the project

In the first place, we are going to set up a new .NET project.

Then, we can scaffold the .NET project :

```bash
dotnet new web --name <replace_it_by_your_application_name>
```

Please note that most .NET apps require at least 1Go of RAM.

Now, we can initialize the `valyent.toml` configuration file, that allows to link the local codebase, to a Valyent application :

```bash
valyent init
```

This command will ask you to select/create a project and an associated application.

## Adding the Dockerfile

Let’s add a Dockerfile so that Valyent can build a Docker image for your application.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

We can fill it this way :

```bash
# Adjust DOTNET_OS_VERSION as desired
ARG DOTNET_OS_VERSION="-alpine"
ARG DOTNET_SDK_VERSION=8.0

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:${DOTNET_SDK_VERSION}${DOTNET_OS_VERSION} AS build
WORKDIR /src

# copy everything
COPY . ./
# restore as distinct layers
RUN dotnet restore
# build and publish a release
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:${DOTNET_SDK_VERSION}
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://+:8080
ENV ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT Production
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "<replace_it_by_your_application_name>.dll" ]
```

## Deploy the project

To expose the application’s port, we need to set up the `PORT` environment variable :

```bash
valyent env set PORT=8080
```

Then, we can deploy the application :

```bash
valyent deploy
```

Once the deployment is finished, type :

```bash
valyent open
```

to see your .NET application in your browser.
