## Introduction

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a powerful PHP web framework known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features. In this article, we'll guide you through deploying a Laravel application to Valyent.

## Prerequisites

- A UNIX-like system (see [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are using Windows) for using the [Valyent CLI](https://docs.valyent.cloud/cli).
- A Valyent account, with a registered payment method (sign up [here](https://console.valyent.cloud/auth/sign-up)).
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed on your machine.

## Installing the Valyent CLI

```bash
curl -L https://cli.valyent.cloud | sh
```

Inspect the installation script [here](https://cli.valyent.cloud) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/valyentdev/cli).

## Authenticating

```bash
valyent auth login
```

## Initializing the Laravel project

If you don't have a Laravel project yet, create one using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel <app-name>
```

Now, change your directory to the newly created Laravel application:

```bash
cd <app-name>
```

## Initializing the project for Valyent

Note that Laravel applications may require at least 512MB of RAM to run.

Initialize the `valyent.toml` configuration file to link your local codebase to a Valyent application:

```bash
valyent init
```

This command will prompt you to select or create a project and an associated application.

## Adding the Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile to enable Valyent to build a Docker image for your Laravel application:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Fill it with the following content:

```bash
# Use the webdevops PHP with Nginx base image version 8.3 on Alpine Linux
FROM webdevops/php-nginx:8.3-alpine

# Install required dependencies for Docker to function
RUN apk add oniguruma-dev libxml2-dev

# Install necessary PHP extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install \
        bcmath \
        ctype \
        fileinfo \
        mbstring \
        pdo_mysql \
        xml

# Copy Composer binary from the official Composer image
COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer

# Install NodeJS and npm
RUN apk add nodejs npm

# Set the document root for the web server
ENV WEB_DOCUMENT_ROOT /app/public

# Set the application environment to production
ENV APP_ENV production

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env
# You can modify the .env.example to configure your site for production
RUN cp -n .env.example .env

# Install and configure your site for production
# https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#optimizing-configuration-loading
RUN composer install --no-interaction --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

# Generate security key
RUN php artisan key:generate

# Optimize Configuration loading
RUN php artisan config:cache

# Optimize Route loading
RUN php artisan route:cache

# Optimize View loading
RUN php artisan view:cache

# Compile Breeze assets (or your site's assets)
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# Set ownership of files to the 'application' user
RUN chown -R application:application .
```

## Adding the .dockerignore file

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker image:

```bash
touch .dockerignore
```

Fill it with the following content:

```bash
.git
.gitignore
node_modules
vendor
.env
.env.example
```

## Deploy the project

We are now ready to deploy the Laravel application to Valyent.

There is a few environment variables that need to be set before we can deploy the application.

Expose the applicationâ€™s port by setting up the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
valyent env set PORT=80
```

Now, deploy the Laravel application:

```bash
valyent deploy
```

Once the deployment is complete, run:

```bash
valyent open
```

to view your Laravel application in your browser.

Please note that this guide assumes a standard Laravel setup. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific Laravel project structure or additional requirements.
