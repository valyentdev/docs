## What is Valyent?

<Info>
  Valyent is in its early stages, and we'd love to hear your feedback. If you'd
  like to help us out in our journey, please [join our Discord
  community](https://discord.valyent.cloud)!
</Info>

Valyent is <ins>a cloud computing orchestration platform</ins>, made _for developers_.

It provides a **simple REST API** — along with a set of tools — that allows developers to spin up instances of their applications _on demand_.

In a _nutshell_, applications are organized into **fleets**, i.e _collections of machines_ that work together to provide a service.
Each **machine** consists in a _OCI (Docker) image_ made a <ins>fast-booting microVM</ins>, that can be _started_, _stopped_, _monitored_, and much more.

This approach gives a **granual control** over your infrastructure while abstracting away the complexities of managing individual servers.

## Open-Source

Valyent believes in the <ins>power of open source</ins> to provide a **better experience** for _developers_.

Valyent's microVMs orchestrator — named Ravel, after [the famous french composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel) — is open-source and
made available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValyentDev/ravel), under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Building Cloud Products on Valyent's Infrastructure

Valyent is in a _journey_ to provide a **solid foundation** on which _developers_, _startups_ and _companies_ can build <ins>cloud products</ins>.

And we are **very excited** to see how developers can build cloud products on top of Valyent' infrastructure!

Valyent could power a wide range of cloud-native products, such as:

- **CI/CD Platforms**: Run _isolated_ <ins>build environments</ins> and _containerized_ <ins>workflows</ins>.
- **Managed Databases**: Offer _cloud-native_ <ins>databases with isolated</ins> <ins>environments</ins>.
- **Object Storage**: Develop <ins>S3-like solutions</ins> with _robust access control_.
- **Secure LLM Environments**: Create _isolated_ <ins>environments</ins> for running <ins>large language models</ins>.
- **Serverless Platforms**: Enable <ins>code execution</ins> without server management, like _AWS Lambda_ or _Azure Functions_.

Or whatever else you can think of!

When **opting** for Valyent as your _underlying infrastructure_,
you don't build on a closed-source labyrinth of inconsistent APIs and documentation.
Rather, you work on _open-source software_, produced by a company **thriving** to offer the <ins>best orchestration layer</ins> to the _cloud computing industry_.

If you are _interested_ in **building** cloud products on top of Valyent' infrastructure,
we'd love to hear from you! <ins>So feel free to reach out!</ins>
